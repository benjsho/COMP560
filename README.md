Comp 560 Final Project

# Abstract
Despite massive strides being made in AI chatbots over the last few years, they are still prone to offering generic, potentially incorrect, and inapplicable responses. With the increasing reliance on chatbots in the present day, more weight has been placed on the importance of accurate, efficient, and pertinent responses. This project aims to explore how a pre-trained, general chatbot and fine-tuned, domain-specific chatbot differ in response relevance. By fine-tuning DialoGPT on a curated dataset focused on a specific topic, I aim to assess whether targeted training can ultimately yield responses that surpass (or at least meet) those of generic, widely used chatbots. Evaluation will be based upon perplexity to measure response relevance.
