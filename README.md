# Abstract
Despite massive strides being made in AI chatbots over the last few years, they are still prone to offering generic, potentially incorrect, and inapplicable responses. With the increasing reliance on chatbots in the present day, more and more weight has been placed on the importance of accurate, efficient, and pertinent responses. This project aims to explore how a pre-trained, general chatbot and fine-tuned, specific chatbot differ in response relevance, and whether a chatbot intentionally trained on a small, specific dataset could compete--in the topic of the dataset it's trained on--with widespread, 'generic' chatbots today. To do so, DialoGPT will be tweaked and trained upon a small, hand-picked dataset, and then its responses will be compared to the default version.
